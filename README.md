# 🏋️ Personal Fitness Tracker

A Python-based fitness tracking application designed to monitor exercise routines and calculate calories burned using structured datasets. The project demonstrates data processing, health analytics, and interactive tracking using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Personal Fitness Tracker helps users:

Track exercise activities

Monitor calorie expenditure

Analyze workout performance

Work with structured fitness datasets

The system uses exercise and calorie datasets to compute estimated energy burn and provide insights into physical activity patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

Build a structured fitness tracking system using Python

Perform data analysis on exercise and calorie datasets

Calculate calorie burn based on activity metrics

Provide a foundation for health analytics applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas (Data processing)

NumPy (Numerical operations)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV-based dataset storage
